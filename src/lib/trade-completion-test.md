2. `handleCompleteTrade()` calls `tradeCompletionService.completeTrade()`
3. Service processes each trade item:
   - Removes cards from giver's collection
   - Adds cards to receiver's collection
   - Removes received cards from receiver's wishlist
4. Updates trade status to 'completed'
5. Shows success message with transfer details
